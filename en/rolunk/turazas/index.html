<p>At the western end of the village, we start from photo tour point 2. From here we go back to the village and through the street south of the bus turn, on the green tourist sign towards Aszófő. Umtil the edge of the forest the red tourist sign goes this way, then at the edge the red sign leads to the left towards the Mill Valley. We&rsquo;ll follow the green sign into the woods. After about 800 meters we go to the right on a wide dirt road that goes 500 meters. On this stretch it is worth looking at the base of the dirt road, where the red, hard, leavy, fire-stony limestone stands out in the filament, bright red flint pebbles. It is worth bending down to grab a beautiful specimen. Soon we will reach a crossroads, at which you will have to go right up to the Fair Mountain. Near the roof, on both sides of the road, you can see abandoned small quarry pits. Looking back south from here there is a beautiful panorama of Tihany Peninsula. Going down the north side of the mountain we get to the photo tour point number 1. Now we go back to the green sign, to the road of Aszófő, and on this we go 500 m towards Aszófő, then turn left towards the vineyards on a dirt road that leads us down to the Mill Valley. Passing through the bridge of the stream, the red tourist sign leads north into the valley. First we touch a resting place, then we get to the gorge of the Szőlősi-Séd, between the Farkó-kő and Bocsár Hill, straight to the photo tour point number 3 and the Noszlopy spring. From here we can get back to Balatonszőlős following the red tourist sign.</p>
<p>The total length of the route is 9 kilometers, about 2 hours, plus, if desired, the time to be spent on each site.</p>
<h3 id="route-2---total-length-of-12-kilometers-about-25-hours">Route 2 - total length of 12 kilometers, about 2.5 hours</h3>
<p>This route is specially recommended for photo shoot! The starting point can be the Nótárius Pension. On the side opposite the pension, above the last house, you can go up to the side of the Csere-hill, up to the forest edge, to the photo tour point number 4. From here we go down to the dirt road and by turning right on the east side of New Hill we will reach the tourist road marked with blue color, which leads us to the left down to the road between Balatonszőlős-Tótvázsony. On the road after about 500 meters towards Tótvázsony a gravel road marking a quarry branches to the right. Following this road, after 250 meters, towards the left, towards the vineyards a dirt road leads us to the photo tour point number 6. From here one of the most beautiful panoramas in the Balaton Uplands opens in the sight. From here we go back to the road and another 500 meters towards Tótvázsony we get to a junction. A marked road to the left leads up to the Wine bar of the Priests, to the photographic tour points 7 and 8. Here  experience meets pleasure and delight for the tourist who wants to have a good time. The wide range of the culinary delight and tasting of fine wines make the enjoyment of this wonderful landscape a unique and memorable taste and experience.</p>
<p>The total length of the route is 12 kilometers, about 2.5 hours, plus, if desired, the time to be spent at each location.</p>
<h3 id="route-3---total-length-of-14-kilometers-about-3-hours">Route 3 - total length of 14 kilometers, about 3 hours</h3>
<p>We leave east of the Nótárius Pension, on the gravel road leading out of the village, next to the riding farm. After about 1200 meters the blue tourist sign crosses the road. Here we turn to the right, down the blue sign, reaching the Hidegkúti-Séd, will lead us into the Evetes Valley. The blue sign will soon leave the valley to the right, but we will continue north in the valley, which is one of the most beautiful and wild gorge valleys of the Balaton Uplands. After nearly 1.5 kilometres from the right a forest road approaches the path along the stream. The forest road parallel to the stream towards Holdkút is crossed by another road that comes from the southeast. It is necessary to turn to the latter, which leads up to Mount Tormán. Passing through the ridge of Mount Torman, on the eastern side of the mountain, we reach another forest route. Here you have to go to the left 500 meters upwards, while touching the former quarries on Mount Tormán. Soon another road will cross, where you have to go right 600 meters. Through this we reach the road marked with a yellow tourist sign, on which you have to go left, up and down 70 meters, until you reach the green tourist sign. Turning to the right at the green signal, after another 500 meter, we reach the top of the Recsek hill (430.8 m), the highest point of the area, the Noszlopy Gáspár Lookout. From here, from photo tour point 5, in clear weather you can enjoy the unrivalled spectacular panorama.</p>
<p>The total length of the route is 14 kilometers, about 3 hours, plus, if desired, the time to be spent at each location.</p>
<h3 id="route-4---total-length-of-20-kilometers-about-4-hours">Route 4 - total length of 20 kilometers, about 4 hours</h3>
<p>This excursion might take a whole day, and there are precisely marked tourist roads to follow. From Balatonszőlős, you can go north up to the Nagy-Gella (416.3 m) on the green signed road. We go from the mountain heading to the north, on the blue marked tourist road, and we can go all the way to the Zádor Castle, to the photo tour points number 9 and 10. From the Zádor castle you can get back to Balatonszőlős following the red sign.</p>
<p>The total length of the route is 20 kilometers, about 4 hours, plus, if desired, the time to be spent at each location.</p>
<h3 id="route-5---total-length-of-12-kilometers-about-25-hours">Route 5 - total length of 12 kilometers, about 2.5 hours</h3>
<p>It leads to an extremely beautiful, wild excursion spot. Marked tourist road does not lead this way. The Gorge Valley of Aszófő-Séd is located southwest of Balatonszőlős, between Meggy Hill, Pogány Cellar, Csengó Hill and Fair Hill. There is a junction of three abundant streams with little buzzers and four springs. Between the steep rock walls, 20-30 meters high, there is a strong echo of streams. From Balatonszőlős, from the end of the village towards Pécsely, on the dirt road climbing up to the Carbon Burning Hill, all along the border of the arable and forest through the Kasza valley we reach this wonderful excursion place.</p>
<p>The total length of the route is 12 kilometers, about 2.5 hours, plus the time to be spent at the excursion point.</p>
